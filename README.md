# Nationwide-Distributed-Energy-Resource-Modelling-and-Analysis
This project aims to model and analyze nationwide distributed energy resources, specifically focusing on solar energy installations. By leveraging cutting-edge AWS technologies, we extract actionable insights from a vast dataset. The project utilizes AWS services such as S3, Glue, Redshift, and integrates with Pyspark, Tableau, and the Boto3 SDK for a comprehensive data processing and analysis pipeline.


## Project Overview
The Nationwide Distributed Energy Resource Modeling and Analysis project uses AWS services to streamline the process from data ingestion to actionable insights. 
The project involves:

> Secure storage of datasets using Amazon S3.

> Data processing with AWS Glue.

> Data warehousing using Amazon Redshift.

> Analytical visualization with Tableau.


## Architecture
### Technologies Used
**AWS S3:** For secure and scalable data storage.

**AWS Glue:** For data processing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.

**Amazon Redshift:** For data warehousing and efficient querying of large datasets.

**Pyspark:** For distributed data processing.

**Tableau:** For data visualization and generating actionable insights.

**Boto3 SDK:** For programmatically interacting with AWS services.
